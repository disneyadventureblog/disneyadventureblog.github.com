Mission: Space is a thrilling simulator ride at Disney’s Epcot park that simulates the physical experience of being an astronaut, right down to the barf bags. But most people skip the equally interesting mental challenge that in the ride's exit area.

Mission: Space Race pits two teams against each other. The teams are piloting an imaginary X-2 space craft. Four players from each team are selected as astronauts and given the challenge of fixing problems on their ship. In order to fix the problems they must use resources uploaded to them by mission control, which can accommodate up to 12 other players on each team.

The astronauts control a simple hand on a video screen. The hand can move up, down, left and right. It can also pick up and drop cubes of a specific color onto the ship. Dropping these cubes in the right location constitutes "fixing a problem". That may sound simple, but you also have to avoid bumping into your follow astronauts’ hands. It’s a puzzle that’s easy enough for a young child to solve but still fun for adults.

The mission control team, back on earth, is solving puzzles of their own. Each puzzle they solve constitutes a “repair” that must be uploaded to the ship. Each upload creates a new colored cube that they astronauts must place on the ship. The mission control players are vying to upload the most fixes on their team.

When the ship is completely repaired, it get's a boost. The boost doesn’t just happen though, one of the players must smash a large red "BOOST" button. It’s very exciting.

Overall, Mission Space Race is a must do at Disney.
