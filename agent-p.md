You can help Perry the Platypus stop the evil Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz in seven
different missions throughout the World Showcase at Disney's Epcot park.

Each mission takes place at a different country pavillion. During the mission,
you'll activate interactive experiences as you explore the location. You are guided
on your mission by a handheld eletronic device called a F.O.N.E.

The countries with missions are:

* Mexico
* Norway
* China
* Germany
* Japan
* France
* UK

Before embarking on your mission, you should pick up a [Doofenslurper](http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2013/02/have-you-tried-the-doofenslurper/)
But don't drink it too quickly or you will get a stomach ache.

You can pick up a F.O.N.E. at the Field Stations located near the World Showcase entrance, between Italy and America, or between France and the UK.
