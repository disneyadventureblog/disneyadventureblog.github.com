Give It A Spin is like Test Track except that you don't drive in the car you designed.
Instead, you drive a digital image of your car on a screen on the floor!

This attraction is located in the After Market Shop near the exit of the Test Track ride.
But you don't need to ride Test Track to visit it. You can skip the ride and enter through the exit.

The first step is designing your personal car. After you scan your Magic Band, you select a body type by dragging a line
that becomes the profile of the car. Don't worry about efficiency--the computer will optimize it
for you. Then you select:

* Length
* Width
* Engine
* Face
* Color and Designs
* Wheel Shape
* Wheel Size
* Accessories for the Front, Side, Top and Back

Now your finished. Because you scanned your Magic Band, the computer system will remember
your car. You can move over to one of the racing tracks located next to the design station.
After scanning your Magic Band again, you custom car will be loaded onto the track and
you can race it against your friends. Now give it a spin!
