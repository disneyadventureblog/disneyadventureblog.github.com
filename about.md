Hi, I'm Vadercat. I've been to Walt Disney World eight times, and I've completed
every Agent P's World Showcase Mission, every Wilderness Explorer Badge, and
every Pirate Adventure Treasure Hunt.

I've also been to Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris, but I don't know which park I like best.
