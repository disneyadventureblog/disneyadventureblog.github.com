In this game, the Magic Kingdom is under attack by Hades. To save the park,
players must battle villains by casting spells and travelling to various
locations.

In order to cast spells, players must use cards that have special powers. The
cards are collectable and can be obtained for free in the Fire Station on Main Street USA.
